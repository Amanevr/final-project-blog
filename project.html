		Blog Post about Survey Questionnaire
		</h1>

		<p>
		I intend to carefully read the questions of the "survey to evaluate the public perception of current electrical and Electronic Waste (E-Waste) management and recycling practices in Sri Lanka". I  willingly participate in this survey to convey my opinion regarding E-Waste. I believe that the information I  provide will be helpful to raise awareness and take necessary actions to protect the environment from the harmful effects of E-Waste. After completing the online survey, I expect to read the awareness blog post on sustainable E-Waste management and the remedial actions taken against E-Waste related environmental problems.

		I hereby give my consent to use the information that I provide for research and academic purposes only. I understand that such activities that fall under the research and academic scope will not reveal my identity or my organization.
